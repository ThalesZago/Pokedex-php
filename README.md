# Pokedex-php
A project made in PHP, HTML5 and CSS3 using the CanalTI API to list Pokemon's name.
I will add some javascript code in the future...

## Run Locally

Clone the project
```bash 
https://github.com/ThalesZago/Pokedex-php.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
cd Pokedex-php
```

Run docker

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Now you can test by yourself :)

## If you don't want to clone the project, you can check it in real time here:
